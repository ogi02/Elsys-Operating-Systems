### Big homeworks
Big homeworks are: 
- 06_tail
- 10_shell
- 15_starcraft
- 16_ls

They require more thinking and more code. After submition, every student explains their code in order to receive a mark.

### Small homeworks
Small homeworks are:
- 01_revision
- 02_bmp_image_processing
- 03_png_image_processing
- 04_head

- 07_watch
- 08_pipe
- 09_named_pipe
- 11_primes
- 12_miners
- 13_zombies
- 14_dealers

They require less thinking and less code.

### Marks

There are 5 marks in total.

4 marks are received for every big homework and the average of those 4 form the final grade. If the final grade is between
two marks, 5th mark is formed. The 5th mark is average of all small homeworks and it is the decider for the final grade

### Academic Honesty

ELSYS is one of the only schools in Bulgaria that has something called Academic Honesty. If you are suspected of cheating, you get sent to the Academic Honesty, where your work is reviewed and you can possibly be punished. The OS teachers keep all the code from previous students, so using the code in this repository is quite risky in my opinion. Use it only for reference
